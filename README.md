# Creating open resources for an introductory data science course

## Abstract

Given that data science has embraced open source in such a big way, we believe that teaching data science should include teaching with open source data science tools and practices, as well as sharing open source educational resources. This follows the old adage, practice what you preach. Open source educational resources have many additional benefits that extend beyond the field of data science, including cost savings for learners, quick iteration on materials for instructors, and raising the quality of the resources by facilitating collaboration. In this talk, we will discuss an open source textbook and complementary assessments for introducing students to data science that we have created at the University of British Columbia. These resources were built authentically using open source data science practices and tools (e.g., R, {bookdown}, Python, Jupyter, Git & GitHub) and have been tested in a first year undergraduate course over 3 years, across more than 1000 students. Specifically we will comment on the initial objectives of the project and how they evolved over time, tooling choices we made and their rationale, our collaboration strategy, as well as several challenges we faced throughout the project and how we overcame those challenges.
