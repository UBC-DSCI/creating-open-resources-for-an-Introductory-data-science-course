# creating-open-resources-for-an-Introductory-data-science-course

ideas:
- objective of the course/history/beginnings of DSCI100
- open textbook/autograded worksheets
- challenges etc
- highlight choices we made, why we made them (e.g., inclusive collaboration, tools, licenses, partnering with CRC Press, etc)
- how we collaborate
